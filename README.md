Hi, I'm @Dan-Peixoto
I'm interested in Back-End development with Python and Ruby, also in creating applications involving HTML5 and JS. I am a student of Systems Development and Analysis at Unijorge University Center. I'm available to work collaboratively on projects involving the aforementioned technologies.
